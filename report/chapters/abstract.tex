This thesis documents the design, implementation, and evaluation of an end-to-end ecommerce data platform that delivers near real-time operational intelligence. The solution unifies cloud-native ingestion, transformation, orchestration, storage, analytics, and delivery capabilities across \gls{aws} and \gls{az}. Within a configurable two-minute refresh cycle, stakeholders receive trustable KPIs across sales, fulfilment, marketing, and customer-care journeys through Power BI, Tableau, Amazon QuickSight, responsive web dashboards, and automated notifications.

The report demonstrates how modern DataOps practices, \gls{iac}, containerisation, continuous delivery, and observability can be orchestrated to achieve resilient, scalable, and secure data services. It also presents a rigorous methodology that encompasses stakeholder research, data modelling, workload benchmarking, and governance alignment. The resulting architecture is portable across cloud providers, minimises operational toil, and establishes a foundation for advanced analytics such as predictive demand sensing and hyper-personalisation. Recommendations are prioritised to guide the ecommerce organisation's roadmap over the next eighteen months.
