    \begin{tabular}{p{3.5cm}p{3cm}p{2.5cm}p{6cm}}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Recommendation} & \textbf{Horizon} & \textbf{Complexity} & \textbf{Expected Benefit} \\
        \midrule
        Launch data product marketplace & Short term & Medium & Enable domain teams to publish discoverable, governed data assets.
\\
        Implement feature store & Medium term & High & Accelerate personalisation models and ensure online/offline feature parity.
\\
        Expand chaos engineering & Medium term & Medium & Validate resilience of streaming pipelines and multi-region failover.
\\
        Introduce FinOps automation & Short term & Low & Optimise cloud spend via automated recommendations and tagging compliance.
\\
        Roll out data literacy programme & Long term & Medium & Empower business units to self-serve analytics responsibly.
\\
        Federate governance council & Long term & High & Scale policy adherence and stewardship as new domains onboard.

\section{Generalisability}
The architectural patterns generalise to other high-velocity domains such as quick-commerce, digital banking, and online gaming. Key prerequisites include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Event-driven transaction systems capable of emitting change data capture events or API webhooks.
    \item Organisational commitment to product-centric ownership of data domains.
    \item Investment in automation, observability, and cloud-native security fundamentals.
\end{itemize}

\section{Strategic Outlook}
Future iterations can integrate machine learning for demand forecasting, anomaly detection, and marketing optimisation. Extending the platform with real-time experimentation frameworks, reinforcement learning, and digital twin simulations will unlock differentiated customer experiences.
