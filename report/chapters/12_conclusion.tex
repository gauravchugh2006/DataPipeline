\chapter{Conclusion}
This thesis has presented a robust, resilient, and ethically governed ecommerce data platform capable of delivering near real-time KPIs across multiple channels. By integrating event-driven ingestion, governed dimensional modelling, automated \gls{ci}/\gls{cd}, and comprehensive observability, the solution addresses the research problem of delivering trustworthy analytics within minutes of operational events. The platform's modularity and dual-cloud readiness ensure longevity as the organisation scales and diversifies.

Beyond technical achievements, the project fostered cross-functional collaboration, strengthened data stewardship, and increased business confidence in data-driven decisions. Continuous improvement roadmaps emphasise experimentation, literacy, and governance, ensuring sustained value. The lessons learned contribute to the wider body of knowledge on cloud-native data engineering and provide a blueprint for organisations seeking to operationalise near real-time intelligence responsibly.
