I extend my sincere gratitude to Dr. Etienne Mauffret for his rigorous mentorship, constructive feedback, and relentless focus on methodological excellence. I am thankful to the ecommerce platform leadership team for granting access to anonymised operational datasets and for articulating the business challenges that shaped this project. My appreciation also goes to my colleagues and peers who stress-tested the pipeline, reviewed documentation, and championed continuous improvement throughout the engagement. Finally, I owe heartfelt thanks to my family for their patience and motivation during the long evenings invested in this final year project.
