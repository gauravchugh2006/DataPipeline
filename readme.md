# Data Pipeline Project

This project implements an end-to-end data pipeline that not only handles the core stages of extraction, loading, transformation, metadata ingestion, and dashboarding but also includes additional stages such as data quality validation, enrichment/aggregation, and logging. The pipeline is built using a modern open-source stack and is orchestrated with Apache Airflow.

---

## Overview

- **Extraction:** Reads data from a CSV source and uploads it into an S3-compatible object store (MinIO) if the file contents have changed.
- **Loading:** Downloads the data from MinIO and loads it into a PostgreSQL data warehouse.
- **Transformation:** Uses DBT to transform raw data into normalized tables with tests and documentation.
- **Data Quality Validation:** Runs automated quality checks with Great Expectations to ensure key business rules are met.
- **Data Enrichment:** Aggregates key performance indicators (KPIs) from transformed data to support dashboard analytics.
- **Orchestration:** Airflow manages the pipeline tasks in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to ensure proper execution order.
- **Metadata & Dashboarding:** DataHub ingests metadata while Superset provides interactive dashboards.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your Windows machine:

- **Windows 10/11**  
- **Docker Desktop for Windows**  
  - Docker Compose support (v2 or later)
- **Git**  
  - [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) if you plan on tracking large files  
- **Python 3.11** (for custom scripts and local testing)  
- **Development Tools:**  
  - A text/code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)  
  - (Optional) Overleaf or a LaTeX editor if you require advanced documentation formatting
