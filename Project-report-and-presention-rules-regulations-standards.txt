Its not a joke You are acting as Highly qualified Solution-Architect (AWS+Azure) with 20 years of experience (10yrs in c# asp.net , .net core, angular/react, MS Sql server, Mongodb, cosmosdb, MySQL, postgresSQL etc. with in-depth databases knowledge+ full stack development and latest 10yrs as Senior Data Engineer roles and responsibilities designing robust, resilient data pipelines delivering realtime automation of reports presenting live KPIs and insights in place on multiple platforms(desktop, mobile, online, offline as per need on powerbi, on tableau, on quicksight, on preformatted and generated pdf, on email, on web application as live(realtime) KPI dashboard updating every 2min etc. using AWS or Azure data engineering tools and services). so be serious to help me as I also have got 12 years of experience 10 years in Full stack software development same that you hold and 2 years as Data engineer using same knowledge of services that you have but with little less expertise you can say if you are rated 9 out of 10 to be preferred candidate for any Technical Leadership role then I am rated as 7.5 out of 10 for same role but this is with 12 years experience I am presenting my final year M.Sc.(cloud computing and data engineering) Project report that should include almost in-depth knowledge everything(tools and services presented in the project i.e. Ecommerce data pipeline solution with realtime KPI dashboard updating every 2-3min frequency configurable as per the scale of orders generated every 2min) that i have learnt and implemented in my Ecommerce-Datapipeline GitHub repo. 

And about the report you just gave in previous merge i analysed it. your report looks okay but I want more better professional, more realistic, more convincing, more formatted and detailed version with graphs and flow charts with more images and logos of tools like the one image it is there presented in EcommerceDatapipeline-AWS-Deployment.png and Ecommerce-ETL-Orchestration.png which also you can use and similar contrasting color formatted icons you can use. you can also use https://github.com/zihaozeng0021/currency-exchange-rate-forecasting/tree/main/report. use report folder structure and .tex files formatting rules but the content structure language pattern and behaviour, headings, sub headings, bullet points style, number of pages in the report span all should follow the sample report file (PFE_Final_Project-sample_report_structure.docx) I gave in GitHub repository and the aivancity logo 

and other rules and standard you have to follow are 
Below are some contextual elements and objectives associated with the final year project.
• General Objectives:
– Demonstrate mastery of the skills acquired during the Master’s program.
– Solve a concrete problem related to data management and analysis.
– Integrate theoretical and practical approaches to Data Engineering.
• Topic Selection: (Ecommerce Data Pipeline solution)
– Must be directly related to the fields of Data Engineering.
– Preference should be given to innovative topics with high added value.
You have to use some sample data design along with some table entities used and their need in 5-6 necessary bullet point along with ER diagram and Use case diagrams etc.

Other sections in my report for MSc Data Engineering & Cloud Computing: Projet de Fin d’étude // Final Year Project must include:-
2 Writing and Structure of the Thesis
While the format may vary depending on the issues addressed and potentially the empirical practices
observed in the field, it is essential that the thesis includes the following elements:
2.1 Problem Statement
This section describes the questions raised and the identified challenges, specifically related to the management,
utilization, and analysis of data. Examples include:
• A hypothesis to validate regarding the performance or biases of an analytical or predictive model.
• A reconsideration or optimization of current data processing methods in a professional context.
• An exploration of the limitations or opportunities presented by new technologies or approaches in
data analysis.
The problem statement must address the concrete needs of the company or professional community:
• It should deal with a real and current issue, such as improving data quality, automating analytical
processes, or implementing solutions that enable better decision-making through data.
• It may include objectives such as cost reduction, increased model accuracy, or identifying new
insights from existing data.
• This problem statement must align with the technical or strategic priorities of the company while
contributing to advancements in data analysis practices and knowledge.
Clarifying a problem statement is not merely an academic requirement. In fact, formalizing this issue
greatly helps the participant in their thinking process and makes their approach more effective. It is also
a key way to demonstrate the ability to integrate approaches, methods, concepts, and tools developed
during the MSc program through the final year project.
Thus, projects that are purely descriptive (e.g., simply presenting the host company, its activities, operations,
and the tasks performed during the internship) should be avoided. Similarly, a purely theoretical
reflection without any practical application is not acceptable. A project that only consists of empirical
work (i.e., simple data collection) without any application of MSc-taught methods and concepts is also
not suitable. Moreover, a project that artificially combines a variety of approaches, methods, concepts,
and tools without prior analysis, real-world application, or clear connection to the problem statement
should also be avoided.
In essence, the final year project must take on a significantly broader and more analytical dimension
than a simple report that the host company might require within the context of the internship.
2.2 Methodology
This section defines the analytical framework and the methods used for data collection, preparation,
and processing. The methodological approach must be clearly described and justified, considering the
specificities of the data and the project objectives.

• Analytical Framework: Clearly define the technical and analytical objectives (e.g., building a predictive
model, optimizing a classification algorithm, or developing an interactive dashboard). Identify
key variables, relationships to explore, and performance indicators.
• Data Collection Methods: Describe how the data was gathered (from existing databases, web
scraping, IoT sensors, APIs, etc.), specifying its source, nature (structured/unstructured), volume, and
quality.
• Data Processing and Analysis: Justify the techniques used for data preparation (cleaning, normalization,
handling missing values) and the tools or algorithms applied for analysis (statistical models,
machine learning, data visualization).
Complete transparency in the approach is essential. This includes:
• A clear explanation of the steps taken to ensure data integrity and result reproducibility.
• Documentation of all methodological choices, such as algorithm selection or hyperparameter tuning,
with justification.
• When mock-up data/schemas if data are confidentials.
• Clear explanation of which generative AI is used, if any, the prompt used and on which part.
The limitations of the methodology must be identified, mentioned, and explained. This may include:
• Biases or inadequacies in the available data.
• Simplifying assumptions made for the analysis.
• Technical or time constraints that influenced the project’s scope.
• This structured framework ensures the scientific rigor and operational relevance of the results produced
in the final year project.
For confidentiality reasons, it is acceptable to anonymize the name of the company and/or the operations
used in the thesis.
Clarifying the methodology is crucial. It demonstrates the participant’s ability to critically assess the
problem at hand. It also enables the reader to validate the conclusions presented and recognize their
potential limitations.

2.3 Results and conclusion
The results of a final year project should not be limited to a mere description of a situation. They must
be analyzed and provide concrete insights in response to the initial problem statement. Recall that data
(and result) themselves are meaningless, but information and knowledge (your expertise) are valuable.
Results stem from the methodology applied to a given problem. It is essential to present them appropriately.
For example, if interviews were conducted with various stakeholders, the interview reports may be
included in an appendix. However, the main thesis should contain a synthesized analysis of the collected
data and a presentation of the key findings.

Based on the analysis results, a set of recommendations should be formulated. These recommendations
must be prioritized. Prioritization can be based on factors such as:
• Nature (technical, commercial, organizational, etc.).
• Implementation complexity (from easiest to most complex).
• Urgency (short-term, medium-term, or long-term).
• Finally, it may be valuable to explore whether the conclusions drawn from the project could be
extended to other similar situations.
2.3.1 Other Essential Sections
Every final year project must include an executive summary outlining the problem statement, analysis
methodology, and key conclusions.
The thesis should also provide a brief presentation of the host company, including details such as activities,
revenue, workforce size, products, locations, and organizational structure. This section is mainly
intended to provide context for the participant’s work, specifying their role within the organization and
the company’s position in its competitive environment.
• A glossary clarifying technical terms or abbreviations used in the text is recommended.
• A table of contents is essential.
• A bibliography is mandatory and must include scientific and/or academic references, not just professional
sources.

3 Formal Aspects of the Thesis
3.1 Length of the Thesis
The main body of the thesis should be approximately 50 pages (excluding appendices, cover pages,
acknowledgments, executive summary, table of contents, and bibliography). The entire document must
be paginated. If there are appendices, an appendix table of contents is mandatory. Each appendix
must have a title.
3.2 Cover Page
The first page must be printed on aivancity letterhead paper. A digital copy of this letterhead will be sent
to you via email. This cover page must include the following elements:
• Aivancity logo
• Host company
• Final project title
• Final Year Project
• MSc Data Management
• Graduating Class 20nn
• Participant: First Name and Last Name
• Supervising Professor: Title, First Name, and Last Name
If you need a LATEXtemplate, contact us as soon as possible so we can provide it to you.
3.3 Bibliographic References, Plagiarism, and Use of Generative AIs
You must rely on an appropriate bibliography. This allows you to expand on topics covered in the MSc
program and possibly initiate new discussions.
References should be cited within the main text, appearing in parentheses with the author’s name
and publication date (whether it’s a book or an article). Example: (Dumoulin, Flipo et al., 1998). The IEEE
convention is also accepted (initials of authors and date: DF98). However, your style must be consistent
through the thesis.
At the end of the thesis, a "Bibliographic References" section should list all cited documents in full
format. Example:
Prunier R., Mourel P. (1996), Financial Engineering in the Bank-Enterprise Relationship, Economica, pp. 73-
75.
Be cautious when including quotations, whether from articles, books, or interviews. For any information
obtained from the Internet, a precise source must be identified both in-text (in parentheses) and in the
bibliography.
Any excerpt from a book, article, website, or any public or private source that is included in the thesis—
no matter how short—has a high probability of being detected by plagiarism detection software. If
such an excerpt is not properly cited (both in-text and in the bibliography), the plagiarism will be confirmed,
and the final project will receive a permanent grade of 0 (zero), with no possibility of a second
chance, meaning the student will be permanently ineligible for graduation.
3.4 Use of Generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT and similar tools)
The use of generative AI is allowed for the final project, but only under strict conditions:
• Full Transparency
• Any use of generative AI must be explicitly mentioned, with a clear description of how it was used
(e.g., to generate ideas, write a paragraph, analyze data, create a visualization, etc.).
• Systematic Citation
Any AI-generated content must be referenced, ideally by specifying:
• The tool used
• The date of generation
• A screenshot or copy of the prompt used (included as an appendix if necessary).
• Reasonable Use
AI tools should be considered as assistive tools, not substitutes for intellectual work. The project must
primarily reflect the skills, ideas, and efforts of the student.
Ethical Considerations:
• AI use must comply with principles of integrity and responsibility.
• It is strictly forbidden to use AI for:
• Generating fake or misleading content
• Bypassing methodological requirements
• Limiting Overuse
Excessive reliance on AI (e.g., generating an entire report or conducting all analyses) will be considered
a violation of academic integrity. Important: AI-generated work may be poorly received if it lacks
meaning or does not reflect critical thinking supported by personal expertise and reflection. AI use does
not replace the need for solid reasoning, analysis, and synthesis skills, which are fundamental to academic
work. Content that is meaningless, even if well-written, will be penalized.
Finally, the school reserves the right to use AI detection tools to analyze submitted work. Excessive or
unjustified AI use will be penalized, potentially leading to non-validation of the thesis.
These rules are in place to promote a responsible and ethical use of digital tools, ensuring the authenticity
and quality of academic work. Any violation will be treated as serious academic misconduct,
carrying the same severe consequences as plagiarism.

4 The Relationship Between the Student and the Supervising Professor
The organization of the relationship between the student and the supervising professor must be mutually
defined by both parties. However, some key steps are essential. The supervising professor will be particularly
attentive to ensuring these commitments are met.
4.1 First Step
The student must present and have the following elements validated by their supervisor before the end of
May:
• Research Question: Three proposed formulations must be submitted.
• Research Problem Statement: A 2 to 3-page document (version 1).
• Bibliographic References: A total of 10 references, including at least 5 scientific articles.
• Brief Presentation of the Planned Empirical Section (1 to 2 pages):
– Describe the project: Data, methods, expected results, type(s) of deliverables.
– Describe the empirical study: Why this study? What empirical methods? (Type of data collected,
methods of analysis, hypotheses).
4.2 Second Step
The student must submit an intermediate document including before August:
• Problem Statement: An updated version.
• Detailed Outline: A structured and precise framework for the thesis.
• Theoretical Section: A literature review summarizing the selected and enriched bibliographic references.
• Implementation Phase:
– Types of data to be collected.
– Detailed presentation of the planned AI/Data techniques.
– Description of the tools or solutions that will be implemented.
This document must be validated by the supervisor before the student can proceed.
4.3 Interaction with the Supervisor
Once the previous steps are validated, the student can move forward with finalizing their thesis project
and writing the dissertation.
The student is solely responsible for reaching out to their supervisor for advice or validation. Under no
circumstances is the supervisor expected to follow up with the student to ensure progress.

4.4 Submission and Defense
The final document must be submitted on the exact date specified by the program administration, as well
as on the scheduled defense day. Any late submission or failure to meet deadlines will be sanctioned in
accordance with the applicable regulations.

5 The supervising professor(i.e. My professor is going to evaluate as he is Ph.d and hold more that 25 years of industry experience.
My supervising professor is playing a methodological guidance role. They are both a source of expertise for
the student and the guarantor of the application of rules concerning the completion of the final project
and the defense.
Throughout the supervision process, the professor’s assessment is focused on the validity conditions and
limitations of the work carried out, considering all or some of the following points:
• Is the research problem relevant? Well-formulated? Clearly defined? Understandable?
• Are the methods used valid for the current situation? Could other methods have been used, and if
so, why were they not?
• Are the results obtained debatable? In light of these results, would it be relevant to supplement
the methods used? How? With which other methods? Would this lead to refining, relativizing, or
challenging the results?
• Is the student’s reasoning relevant? How reliable is it? What are its limitations?
• Are the results obtained understandable? Can they be compared to other, more general results or
results obtained in different circumstances? Does this comparison or confrontation give a different
meaning to the results?
• To what extent can the approach taken and the methods employed be generalized?
• Is the structure of the thesis (see next section) acceptable?
• Is the research problem relevant? Well-formulated? Clearly defined? Understandable?
• Are the methods used valid for the current situation? Could other methods have been used, and if
so, why were they not?
• Are the results obtained debatable? In light of these results, would it be relevant to supplement
the methods used? How? With which other methods? Would this lead to refining, relativizing, or
challenging the results?
• Is the student’s reasoning relevant? How reliable is it? What are its limitations?
• Are the results obtained understandable? Can they be compared to other, more general results or
results obtained in different circumstances? Does this comparison or confrontation give a different
meaning to the results?

All questions above should properly answered through the material presented professionally and properly formatted with headings, subheadings, bullet points (ordered/unordered wherever/however needed) and graphs and charts and tables, flow charts in my report

other important point(s) to be considered while developing report like :-
• To what extent can the approach taken and the methods employed be generalized?
• Is the structure of the thesis (see next section) acceptable?
6 The Thesis Defense
6.1 The Defense: right to Defend and Organization
The final project defense takes place in the presence of the supervising professor and a qualified assessor
(often the Program Director or a permanent professor at Aivancity). If the student wishes, their internship
supervisor from the host company or, failing that, a company representative may attend, though they do
not participate in the deliberation.
The supervising professor alone decides whether to grant the student the right to defend their final
project. This defense is only permitted once the final project is deemed definitively acceptable, based on
the criteria outlined above.
The supervising professor gives their approval for the student to proceed with the defense.
6.2 During the Defense
The student must present their approach and results within 20-21 minutes. This presentation(slide show) should not simply
be a reading of the final project. The presentation format will play a significant role in the evaluation.
A 20-minute period will follow for questions and discussion with the jury members. Finally, the jury will
provide a 10-minute debriefing for the student.
At the end of the defense, the jury will assign a grade for both the final project and the defense.
6.3 Confidentiality of the Final Project
The final project written as part of the MSc program may contain confidential information that the company
wishes to keep undisclosed. In such cases, and upon the company’s request, a confidentiality
agreement co-signed by the company, the student, and Aivancity may be established.
6.4 Final Words
Your project must be directly related to the subjects covered in the MSc program. While this may seem
obvious, it can be tempting to be swayed by a company’s name, reputation, or activities, even if the final
project would be far removed from the topics covered in the MSc. Resist this temptation!
Your project must allow you to develop a genuine final project. Ensure that the company hosting you
fully understands the concept of a final project. You should quickly define the research problem you
worked on. Ideally, the company(client is an ecommerce platform provider) should allowed you some time to start writing your thesis during the final
