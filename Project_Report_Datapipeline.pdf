(# Architecture Overview) Tj
0 -14 Td
(  The solution follows a modular layered architecture: data ingestion, orchestration,) Tj
0 -14 Td
(  modelling, serving, and experience delivery. Infrastructure modules group networking,) Tj
0 -14 Td
(  compute, storage, and security primitives.) Tj
0 -14 Td
() Tj
0 -14 Td
(## High-Level Components) Tj
0 -14 Td
(    - Data Ingestion Layer: Kafka-compatible stream via AWS Kinesis Data Streams \(extensible) Tj
0 -14 Td
(       to Azure Event Hubs\).) Tj
0 -14 Td
(    - Processing Layer: Apache Airflow orchestrations executing Python operators and dbt) Tj
0 -14 Td
(       models.) Tj
0 -14 Td
(    - Storage Layer: Amazon S3 for raw and curated zones, Amazon RDS PostgreSQL warehouse) Tj
0 -14 Td
(       \(portable to Azure Blob and Azure Database for PostgreSQL\).) Tj
0 -14 Td
(    - Serving Layer: RESTful APIs and React frontend containerised for ECS Fargate with) Tj
0 -14 Td
(       parallels in Azure Container Apps.) Tj
0 -14 Td
(    - Observability Layer: Prometheus-compatible metrics and structured logging shipped to) Tj
0 -14 Td
(       CloudWatch \(or Azure Monitor\).) Tj
0 -14 Td
() Tj
0 -14 Td
() Tj
0 -14 Td
(## Data Flow) Tj
0 -14 Td
(    Synthetic orders emulate browse-to-purchase journeys and land in the ingestion bucket.) Tj
0 -14 Td
(    Airflow DAGs apply validation, enrichments, and merge operations before persisting) Tj
0 -14 Td
(    dimensional models. The dbt project builds incremental models, and the resulting) Tj
0 -14 Td
(    datasets feed visualisations as well as the customer API.) Tj
0 -14 Td
() Tj
0 -14 Td
() Tj
0 -14 Td
(## Component Interaction) Tj
0 -14 Td
(    - Airflow invokes dbt via KubernetesPodOperator or ECSOperator, ensuring execution parity) Tj
0 -14 Td
(       across environments.) Tj
0 -14 Td
(    - Jenkins pipelines publish application images to Amazon ECR and trigger ECS rolling) Tj
0 -14 Td
(       updates with health checks.) Tj
0 -14 Td
(    - Terraform outputs share load balancer endpoints, security group IDs, and credential) Tj

(## Airflow Orchestration) Tj
0 -14 Td
(    Two primary DAGs run on staggered schedules: the order generator and the end-to-end data) Tj

() Tj
0 -14 Td
(## dbt Modelling) Tj
0 -14 Td
(    The dbt project structures staging, intermediate, and mart models. Macros enforce naming) Tj

() Tj
0 -14 Td
(## Data Quality Controls) Tj
0 -14 Td
(    - Great Expectations-style assertions within Airflow operators for row counts, null) Tj
0 -14 Td
(       ratios, and schema compatibility.) Tj
0 -14 Td
(    - dbt tests run within CI pipelines to prevent regressions before deployment.) Tj
0 -14 Td
